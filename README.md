# <Horiseon-Site-Refactored>

## Description

This project was an attempt to add accessibility to Horiseon's site. The original site was functional but mostly used <div> tabs to separate the sections rather than semantic tags. Alternate text was also added to all pictures making the site more accessible to the vision-impaired community. I learned a ton on this project including how to use semantic html and how to group codes in css to clean up the code.
